This repository documents my learning and progress as I attempt to build a modern computer from NAND gates while reading [The Elements of Computing Systems](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/elements-computing-systems).
Most of the chips are visualized in logic gates [here](https://circuitverse.org/users/224071).


## Technologies
 * [The Nand to Tetris Software Suite](https://www.nand2tetris.org/software)
